              Atatürk was a Turkish nationalist leader and founder and first
              president of the republic of Turkey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was born in 1881 in Salonika (now
              Thessaloniki) in what was then the Ottoman Empire. His father was
              a minor official and later a timber merchant. When Atatürk was 12,
              he was sent to military school and then to the military academy in
              Istanbul, graduating in 1905.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1911, he served against the Italians in Libya and then in the
              Balkan Wars (1912 - 1913). He made his military reputation
              repelling the Allied invasion at the Dardanelles in 1915.
            </p>
            <p>
              In May 1919, Atatürk began a nationalist revolution in Anatolia,
              organising resistance to the peace settlement imposed on Turkey by
              the victorious Allies. This was particularly focused on resisting
              Greek attempts to seize Smyrna and its hinterland. Victory over
              the Greeks enabled him to secure revision of the peace settlement
              in the Treaty of Lausanne.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1921, Atatürk established a provisional government in Ankara.
              The following year the Ottoman Sultanate was formally abolished
              and, in 1923, Turkey became a secular republic with Atatürk as its
              president. He established a single party regime that lasted almost
              without interruption until 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
              He launched a programme of revolutionary social and political
              reform to modernise Turkey. These reforms included the
              emancipation of women, the abolition of all Islamic institutions
              and the introduction of Western legal codes, dress, calendar and
              alphabet, replacing the Arabic script with a Latin one. Abroad he
              pursued a policy of neutrality, establishing friendly relations
              with Turkey's neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1935, when surnames were introduced in Turkey, he was given the
              name Atatürk, meaning 'Father of the Turks'. He died on 10
              November 1938.
